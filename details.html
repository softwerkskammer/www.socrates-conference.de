						The event will be run as a two day Open Space, facilitated by <a href="http://blog.connexxo.com/" target="_blank">Pierluigi Pugliese</a>, a highly skilled facilitator.
					</p>
					<p>
						After last year's feedback we decided to do without any set sessions and focus on the power of the participants. You can get further impressions of an Open Space <a href="http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace" target="_blank">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Facilitation will be in English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Main Event
					</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>August 2-4 2012</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The SoCraTes conference will take place from the evening of Thursday August 2nd 2012 (about 5pm) through the evening on Saturday August 4th 2012. So we will have 48 hours to collaborate and share.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Additional Code Retreat
					</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>August 5 2012</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The main event will be followed by a <a href="http://coderetreat.org/" target="_blank">Code Retreat</a> on Sunday (until about 6pm). This will be a <strong>separate, optional</strong> event which is not included in the conference.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Important note:</strong> Participation at the code retreat will cause additional accomodation costs!

				<h4>
					Rooms
				</h4>
				<p>
					The facility offers about 50 rooms. Most of these rooms have two seperated beds. <strong>Therefore we strongly encourage that you choose the "shared room" option during registration</strong>. Remember that everybody who prefers a single room, simultaniously imposes a limitation to the number of people that can join SoCraTes. Anyway you'll need your room mainly for sleeping. The event's format also gives you the possibility to have a shower any time you want! ;)
				</p>
				<p>
					You can let us know whom you'd be willing to share a room with. Even if you don't know anybody just yet, we are sure that somebody is willing to do so. After registration there will also be a wiki for participants to get to know each other and arrange things.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Money
				</h4>
				<p>
					Thanks to our generous sponsors we'll be able to keep the costs down. These are the targeted fees for the main event (including everything except the evening drinks at the bar):
				</p>
				<p>
					The total price for the conference participation, two overnight stays, meals and coffee will not exceed 250 Euros. The exact amount depends on the number of sponsors we are able to attract. If we find enough sponsors the conference will cost less than 200.- Euros.</p>
					<p>Last year the participants only had to pay the accomodation for two nights including breakfast. These fees are about 70 € per night for a shared room and 85 € per night for a single room.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Location
				</h4>
				<p>
					Out in the country, at the lovely Seminarzentrum Rückersbach (<a href="http://www.natuerlich-tagen.de/" title="Herzlich Willkommen im SeminarZentrum Rückersbach" target="_blank">German only website</a>), one hour from Frankfurt (Main) airport.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=200871005776196874621.0004bae59888624a30481&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=50.015876,8.857491&amp;spn=0.070623,0.572534&amp;source=embed" target="_blank">Kolpingstraße 1, 63867 Johannesberg, Germany</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					It offers great facilities for community-centered events with included accomodation. We have rented the whole facility, so we can concentrate on what we like to do most.
				</p>
				<h3>
