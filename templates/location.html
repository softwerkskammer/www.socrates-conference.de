    <h1>The Location <span class="text-muted">a lovely place.</span></h1>

<p class="lead">
    Out in the country, at the lovely Hotelpark Soltau,
    approximately one hour from Hamburg.
</p>

<p>
    It offers great facilities for community-centered events with included accommodation. We
    have rented the whole facility, so we can concentrate on what we like to do most.

<h3>Rooms</h3>

<p>
    Some of the facility's rooms are twin rooms. An important aspect of
    SoCraTes is its closedness where everything happens in the same location. Therefore, we can
    only accept as many participants as there are beds available.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="{% url 'registration' %}">When you register</a>, you can let us know whom you'd be willing to share a room with. Even if
    you don't know anybody just yet, we will do all we can to find a suitable roommate for you.
    After registration there will also be a wiki for participants to get to know each other and
    arrange things.
